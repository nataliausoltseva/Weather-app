# Weather-app

By default the web-app shows the weather for Auckland with forecast for today, tomorrow and a day after.  The forecast is shown hourly and a user has a chance to scroll it if the hours do not fit on the page. It shows the UV level and on hover it will show what protection is needeed and what recommendations about that level. 

This app only supports Autocomplete search for New Zealand and Russian cities.

Plans:
- Make this application to be geo-based so it would show the weather for the city based on the user's location if possible, otherwise to show the big city information on the home page
- Make favourite button to keep specific cities on the home page
- Instead of making a call straight away, make a link button to a specific city so a user does not need to search and can mamke a call by clicking on the button
